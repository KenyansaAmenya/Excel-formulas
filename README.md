# Relative reference
References are relative by default, and are without dollar sign ($).
The relative reference makes the cells reference free. It gives the fill function freedom to continue the order without restrictions.
# Absolute reference
Absolute reference is when a reference has the dollar sign ($).
It locks a reference in the formula.
Add $ to the formula to use absolute references.
The dollar sign has three different states:
Absolute for column and row. The reference is absolutely locked.
Absolute for the column. The reference is locked to that column. The row remains relative.
Absolute for the row. The reference is locked to that row. The column remains relative.
# Functions
Excel has many premade formulas, called functions.
Functions are typed by = and the functions name.
Once you have typed the function name you need to apply it to a range.
The range is always inside of parentheses.
# Function	# Description
=AND	Returns TRUE or FALSE based on two or more conditions
=AVERAGE	Calculates the average (arithmetic mean)
=AVERAGEIF	Calculates the average of a range based on a TRUE or FALSE condition
=AVERAGEIFS	Calculates the average of a range based on one or more TRUE/FALSE conditions
=CONCAT	Links together the content of multiple cells
=COUNT	Counts cells with numbers in a range
=COUNTA	Counts all cells in a range that has values, both numbers and letters
=COUNTBLANK	Counts blank cells in a range
=COUNTIF	Counts cells as specified
=COUNTIFS	Counts cells in a range based on one or more TRUE or FALSE condition
=IF	Returns values based on a TRUE or FALSE condition
=IFS	Returns values based on one or more TRUE or FALSE conditions
=LEFT	Returns values from the left side of a cell
=LOWER	Reformats content to lowercase
=MAX	Returns the highest value in a range
=MEDIAN	Returns the middle value in the data
=MIN	Returns the lowest value in a range
=MODE	Finds the number seen most times. The function always returns a single number
