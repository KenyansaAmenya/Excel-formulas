# Relative reference
References are relative by default, and are without dollar sign ($).
The relative reference makes the cells reference free. It gives the fill function freedom to continue the order without restrictions.
# Absolute reference
Absolute reference is when a reference has the dollar sign ($).
It locks a reference in the formula.
Add $ to the formula to use absolute references.
The dollar sign has three different states:
Absolute for column and row. The reference is absolutely locked.
Absolute for the column. The reference is locked to that column. The row remains relative.
Absolute for the row. The reference is locked to that row. The column remains relative.
